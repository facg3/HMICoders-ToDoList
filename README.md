# What is TDD?

Test-driven development is a programming methodology with which one can tackle the design, implementation, and testing of units of code, and to some extent the expected functionality of a program.

## How we work ?
in our time we work Pair programming , we divide the function 3 functions , 2 take 2 function and 2 take the one function ,and switch between pairs to make test for every function .

## The files in our project:-
logic.js     : functions .

test.js      : test for the functions in logic.js.

dom.js       :access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

style.css    : To give our project a nice form .

index.html   : To write a paragraph and tittle .


## Our-work :
-  Hanan and Dalal make a add function and Test for other pairs function and Do the Style for the project by CSS .

-  Mahmoud and Ismail make delete and mark function and test our added function .
  and Do define the function inside the Dom file to create complete function .

  We hava taken in our project the issue of Accessibility and mobile first .

## Our-Stories:

   * As a busy person  you  can now :

- Enter tasks you need to do into a web page so you will never forget them.

- View the tasks you have added in a list .

- Mark tasks as complete so you can focus on the tasks that's have't done .

- Delete the task that's you dont want it .
