# HMICoders-ToDoList
Our to do list
The project

User stories:

As a disorganised person I want to:

enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb
Potential stretch goals

As a disorganised person I want to:

edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes
click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
a visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing
Part one: create some pure functions

For the first part of the project you will be creating three functions using TDD. You do not need to understand the rest of the code to complete this. The three functions can be thought of in isolation to the rest of the project.

These functions are in the todoFunctions object in logic.js

What is a to-do array? What is a to-do?

We will represent a todo as an object with three properties:
What does generateId do?

You do not need to understand this function. Each time you call generateId it will give you a unique number!

What does cloneArrayOfObjects do?

Makes a copy of your array of objects, so that if you make changes to the new array or its objects, the originial remains unchanged.
